🔧 How It Works
1.	A device (called a server) shares one or more folders or drives over the network.
2.	Other devices (called clients) connect to that shared folder using a file sharing protocol.
3.	Once connected, clients can:
o	Browse shared files and folders.
o	Open or edit documents (depending on permissions).
o	Copy files to/from the server.
o	Upload new files.
