🎩 Story Title: The Brave Magician and the Mysterious Library
 
 
---
 
Speaker 1 – Introduction (1 minute)
 
Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a young magician named Arin. He loved to read about ancient spells and secrets. One day, he heard from an old man that there was a hidden library deep inside the forest, filled with magical books.
Arin decided to visit that library to learn more about his powers. He told his friends, “I’m going to find that library tonight.”
His friends warned him, but Arin was brave. He packed his wand, a small lantern, and left as the sun went down.

Speaker 2 – Reaching the Library (1 minute)
 
After walking for hours, Arin finally found the old library. It was huge, dusty, and quiet. There were tall shelves filled with books that glowed faintly.
Suddenly, the clock on the wall struck midnight, and the sound echoed through the room.
As the clock struck twelve, the doors shut automatically! Arin realized he was trapped inside. But instead of being scared, he whispered to himself, “I must stay calm. Magic always has a reason.”

Speaker 3 – The Thunderstorm (1 minute)
 
Outside, a terrible thunderstorm began. Lightning flashed through the windows, and thunder shook the building.
The books started to fall, and one special book opened by itself.
Inside, it said: “Only the brave can unlock the truth.”
Arin remembered what his teacher had once said. His teacher had told him that true magic comes from courage and kindness.

Speaker 4 – The Magic Test (1.5 minutes)
 
Suddenly, a bright light appeared and an old spirit from the book spoke.
It said, “Arin, to leave this library, you must prove your bravery.”
Arin was frightened, but he took a deep breath. He raised his wand and began to chant a spell he had only read once.
The storm grew stronger, but Arin didn’t stop. He kept believing in himself.
When he finished the spell, the thunderstorm slowly faded, and the clock stopped ticking.
The spirit smiled and said, “You have passed the test. Remember, bravery is the greatest magic of all.”
 
(👉 Reported speech 2: The spirit said that bravery was the greatest magic of all.)

Speaker 5 – Ending (1.5 minutes)
 
The next morning, Arin’s friends found him outside the forest, holding an old glowing book.
They asked what had happened inside. Arin smiled and said, “It was a night I’ll never forget.”
From that day on, he became known as the Brave Magician who turned fear into strength.
The clock from the library now hangs in his home — always reminding him that time and courage can change everything.

🌟 Moral:
 
Bravery isn’t about being fearless — it’s about facing fear with courage and believing in yourself.

Would you like me to divide who speaks what (like exact dialogue lines for each of the 5 members)? That way it’ll sound more like a group performance.
